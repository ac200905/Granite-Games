## Vision In The Dark: Design Document

### Concept
Far in the future, Robots are mass produced on Space stations that orbit Earth.
You play as a small defective engineering robot with broken optical sensors who must rely on a broken sensor that pulses intermittently, discarded and doomed to be recycled, your Objective is to find spair parts and repair yourself and escape the station.
You escape destruction in the tutorial level and must use tmeporary vision to guide your escape of the station.

### Art Style
* Vector art.
* with non vibrant colours.
* Minimalist and atmospheric art style like in Limbo and Sunless Sea. Mostly in black and white.

### Mechanics
* With physics based movement, the player controls thrusters on the character to change horizontal and vertical speed and momentum. 
#### Vision mechanic
* An intermittent pulse of vision projects from the players position allowing you to see a radius around the player.
* The pulse will slowly fade away quickly over time.
* Things further from you look blurry.
* Every 5 levels there is a spair component to collect that will upgrade your vision mechanic.
#### collectible Powerups
* Protective forcefield - allows you to take damage once, saving your life.

### Rules
* Don’t bash into anything! Speeding into a wall to fast will kill you.
* The robot is already damaged and thus very fragile, any collisions with enough force could make its reactor core go critical.

### Level Design
* procedually generated levels.
* Each individual room is designed with varying traps and moving obstacles to avoid. 
* Later levels generate more difficult rooms to increase the challenge.
* 30 levels.
* Boss fight every 10 levels.

### Objectives and Goals
* Main Objective: Escape the Station.
* Find collectibles to upgrade your sensors.
* Get to the end of each level.

### Obstacles
* Stationary and moving Saw blades that the player must avoid to not get killed.
* Trap Spikes that the player must avoid.
* Laser beams that turn on and off, the player must not touch them and get past them.
* Gravity well that attracts the player to it's centre destroying you, player must avoid getting sucked in by it.

### Bosses
* Boss 1: Manufacturing robot arm that needs to be avoided and switched off to beat it.
* Boss 2: 
* Boss 3:

### UI and menus
* Main menu when starting the game with buttons to play, settings, exit game, level select.
* Pause menu while playing the game, allows you to return to main menu and change settings.

### Music and sound effects
* Type of music: Calm and eerie music.
* Player sounds include: thruster, collision, interaction, and vision sounds.
* Obstacles sound effects for the different obstacles.

### Player conrols
* WASD keys for movement.
* E key for interactions.
* potential controller support
