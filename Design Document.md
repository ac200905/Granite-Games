## Vision In The Dark: Design Document

### Concept
Far in the future, Robots are mass produced on Space stations that orbit Earth.
You play as a small defective engineering robot with broken optical sensors who must rely on a broken camera that pulses every 2 seconds, discarded and doomed to be recycled, your Objective is to find spair parts and repair yourself.
You escape destruction in the tutorial level and must use tmeporary vision to guide your escape of the station.

### Mechanics
* With physics based movement, the player controls thrusters on the character to change horizontal and vertical speed and momentum. 
#### vision mechanic
* An intermittent static pulse of vision projects from the players position allowing you to see a radius around the player.
* The pulse will slowly fade away over time.

### Rules
* Don’t bash into anything!
* The robot is already damaged and thus very fragile, any collisions with enough force could make its reactor core go critical.

### Level Design
* procedually generated levels.
* Each individual room is designed with varying traps and moving obstacles to avoid. 
* Later levels generate more difficult rooms to increase the challenge.
* Minimalist and atmospheric art style like in Limbo and Sunless Sea. Mostly in black and white.

### Target Market
* 16 – 30 year olds.
* Gamers who enjoy difficult games like Super Meat Boy and Spelunky.


#### Player conrols
* WASD keys
* potential controller support
